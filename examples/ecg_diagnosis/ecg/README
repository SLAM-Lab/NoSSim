The following files will be found in this directory:

Makefile		`make' description file for compiling the application
README			this file
flow.c			Analyzes and classifies the ECG signal using either wqrs or sqrs as R peak detector
noiseremoval.c		Filters signal at 1-50Hz bandwidth
svmpredict.c		Classifies a single heartbeat
mysqrs.c		Detects R peaks using the sqrs R peak detector
mywqrs.c		Detects R peaks using the wqrs R peak detector
mydwt.c			Applies DWT on the heartbeat and extracts requested coefficients
post_request.c		Sends diagnosis data to remote server
svm.h			Functions and structures used by svmpredict.c are declared in this header file
svm.cpp			Needed for svmpredict.c to be linked with 
script.py		Script to run the application with different inputs
configs			Folder containing configurations regarding the feature vector, signal interpolation and wavelet
data_i			Folder containing ECG signals digitized at i samples per second
models_i		Folder containing configurations regarding the svm models for signals digitized at i samples per second
res_i 			Folder to store results for signals digitized at i samples per second
wavelets		Folder containing the filters associated with different wavelets

'flow' Usage: flow configs/config_i.txt confi_output1.txt confi_output2.txt data_i.txt model_config_i.txt

configs/config_i.txt	is the feature vector, wavelet, interpolation and R peak detector configuration
confi_output1.txt	is the stored output regarding the filtering and segmentation stage execution times
confi_output2.txt	is the stored output regarding the feature extraction and classification stage execution times
data_i.txt		is the inputed ECG signal
model_config_i.txt	is the inputed svm model which corresponds to the feature vector configurations

variable no_of_input_windows sets the number of signal frames read
variable input_signal_window sets the window (3000 samples being the minimum when using wqrs) on which the analysis and classification is to be applied
